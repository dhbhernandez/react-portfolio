      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Diego A. Hernandez. I am originally from Colombia. I have been living in the United States since August 2001,
        first I moved to Boston, to learn english. In January 2002, I moved to Houston, Texas. since then I have been living there.
        I graduated from high school in 2005. I tried going to school, but I had to work instead. After working in different jobs,
        I ended up working in the oilfield. I started working doing the Seismic for oil and gas companies for over 5 years.
        ended up traveling all over the USA. in 2015 when the oil market closed, I lost my job and found it pretty difficult to get
        back up, so I ended up getting a Commercial driver's license, hoping that I will be ok. After all this time I realized that
        I love working on computers, in fact I built my computer without knowing anything on how to build it. I realized how I love
        working in technology, so here I am trying to do my best to learn everything about programming.
